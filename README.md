# Hello-World

## *Welcome to my Profile!*

I am a **first year** Business Analytics Student and learning how to code more *fluently* this semster! 
I'm also a part time work at the University of Iowa as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and have found myself enjoying the process a **bunch**!

Some of my Interests include (but not limited to)...
- Hiking
- Running
- Watching Star Wars & their spin offs

I am looking forward to talking and communicating further with you all :)
